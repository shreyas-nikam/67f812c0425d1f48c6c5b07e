# Covariance Uncertainty Visualizer: Technical Specifications

## Overview
This Streamlit application focuses on visualizing the impact of covariance uncertainty on portfolio risk, as illustrated in the "Worst-case risk analysis" example. It aims to provide an interactive tool for exploring the range of possible covariance matrices and their effects on portfolio risk.

## Features

### Nominal Covariance Matrix
- **Display**: The nominal covariance matrix (`Sigma_nom`) is presented as a heatmap or correlation matrix.
- **Functionality**: Allows users to view and understand the baseline covariance matrix against which uncertainties are measured.

### Uncertainty Set Visualization
- **Functionality**: Generates random covariance matrices within the uncertainty set `S` and displays them using heatmaps or scatter plots.
- **Visualization**: Users can visually inspect how the uncertainty affects the covariance matrix, aiding comprehension of its possible variations.

### Risk Distribution
- **Calculation**: Computes portfolio risk (`w.T @ Sigma @ w`) for each covariance matrix in the uncertainty set.
- **Visualization**: Displays the distribution of risk values using a histogram or density plot to show the range of potential risks under uncertainty.

### Sensitivity Analysis
- **Exploration**: Enables users to explore how variations in uncertainty parameters, such as `delta`, influence the risk distribution.
- **Interactivity**: Users can adjust parameters and see real-time updates to how these affect the visualized risk distribution.

### Interactive Charts
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Incorporate line charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots to dynamically illustrate trends and correlations.
- **User Engagement**: Enhances understanding through interactive data exploration.

### Annotations & Tooltips
- **Explanatory Insights**: Provide detailed insights and tips directly on the charts to assist users in interpreting the data.
- **Information Accessibility**: Enhance user experience by giving context and explanations where needed.

## Formula Explanation

### Portfolio Risk
- **Formula**: Risk is calculated using `risk = w.T @ Sigma @ w`, where `w` represents the portfolio weights and `Sigma` is the covariance matrix.
- **Description**: This formula calculates the overall variance (or risk) of the portfolio based on the covariance between the assets.

### Uncertainty Set
- **Formula**: `S = {Sigma_nom + Delta : |Delta_ij| <= delta}`.
- **Description**: Describes the range of covariance matrices within the uncertainty set, where `Delta` represents the deviation from the nominal matrix (`Sigma_nom`) and `delta` controls the extent of this deviation.

## Learning Outcomes
