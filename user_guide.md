# Probability of Default (PD) Model Development:   A User Guide  This codelab provides a comprehensive walkthrough of building and evaluating Probability of Default (PD) models using a Streamlit application.  PD models are crucial for financial institutions to assess the likelihood that a borrower will default on their debt obligations. Through this guide, you'll learn about data preparation, model training, calibration, threshold selection, and performance evaluation â€“ all essential steps in developing robust PD models. By the end of this codelab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use this application to build and compare different PD models.    ## Data Preparation & EDA Duration: 00:10    In this step, we will explore the first page of the Streamlit application, which focuses on data preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This is a crucial initial step in any machine learning project as it helps us understand the data we are working with and prepare it for model training.  First, select "Data Preparation & EDA" from the navigation bar in the sidebar.
